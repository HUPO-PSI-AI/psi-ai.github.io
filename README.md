# PSI-AI: Advancing AI-Readiness of Public Proteomics Data

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **HUPO-PSI AI Readiness Working Group**. Our goal is to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and public proteomics data. We focus on two complementary aims:

1. Making public proteomics datasets suitable for AI applications  
2. Supporting and standardizing the use of AI in workflows that generate new data

We pursue these goals by leveraging community standards and building reproducible, accessible pipelines. Our efforts are integrative and collaborative—we align with existing infrastructure and initiatives rather than duplicating them.

## Mission Statement

The PSI-AI working group develops tools, formats, and guidelines to make proteomics data **FAIR, standardized, and AI-compatible**. We emphasize community involvement and interoperability across the proteomics and machine learning ecosystems.

## Goals

1. **Improve Metadata Accessibility**  
   Support the active and retroactive annotation of public proteomics datasets to enhance discoverability and reuse in AI workflows. This includes enrichment via community pipelines, standard-aligned annotation, and centralized indexing.

2. **Harmonize Raw Data Formats**  
   Promote the conversion of proprietary raw files into standardized open formats (e.g., mzML, mzPeak) anchored in existing repositories, supporting long-term usability and computational workflows.

3. **Enable Low-Barrier Reprocessing**  
   Develop and distribute lightweight, user-friendly workflows that transform raw data into machine learning–ready formats.

4. **Establish Benchmark Resources**  
   Create curated, standardized corpora of diverse proteomics datasets for method development, comparison, and evaluation of AI models.

5. **Support Good Practices in Reuse**  
   Define and disseminate best practices for ethical, transparent, and reproducible reuse of public datasets in AI pipelines.

6. **Contribute to AI Standardization in Proteomics**  
   Collaborate on benchmarking frameworks and integrate existing PSI standards into AI workflows. Encourage community participation through surveys, training, and collaborative events.
